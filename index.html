									<em> "The last frontier is the human mind and we are its pioneers." - Prey 2017 </em>
									<br>
									<br>
									Hello!
									<br>
									<br>
									I am TayLee Young, a third year college student at DigiPen Institute of Technology.
									I am currently studying Computer Science and Game Design. I focus in systems programming, 
									data analysis, and game development. I am proficient in C, C++, C#, and I am learning Python, 
									CSS and HTML. I am also familiar with Unity, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio.
									<br>
									I have worked on several projects, some of which you can find in the Work section. I have 
									worked teams, big and small, and I have experience in project management and team leadership.
									Of course, I am always looking to expand my knowledge and experience.
									<br>
									<br>
									I am deeply motivated to create games that are more than just entertainment. I want to create
									works of art -- art that inspires people to see things in a new light, to create deeply personal
									and provocative worlds, and to challenge the status quo. I want to not only create games,
									but to create experiences that change people's lives.
									<br>
									I am heavily inspired by games like Prey, Night in the Woods, Journey, Silent Hill,
									and Minecraft. These have impacted my life in ways that I never thought possible. Some 
									inspired my path for game design, others have inspired my deep love and appreciation 
									for the art of creation. I will always remember with fondness the first time I played these games,
									as they have made me who I am today!
									<br>
									<br>
									With every project I am in and every team I am apart of, I push strongly for inclusivity, 
									diversity, and accessibility. I believe that games are for everyone. All people, regardless
									of their background, should experience the joy of this art. As a member of the LGBT+ community,
									I know firsthand the importance of representation, inclusion, and acceptance. No one should 
									feel isolated in their experience. This is my mission and goal. To create games that are for
									everyone, that inspire everyone, and that change everyone.
									<br>
									<br>
									Currently, I am apart of team Practically Malware, creating a student game project
									about catching, selling, and breeding moths. Feel free to read about that too!
									I am looking for internships and job opportunities, so feel free to contact me anytime!
