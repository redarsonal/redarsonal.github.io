									<h1><strong><i>Refraction</i></strong></h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									You find yourself lost in the depths of a dungeon. It's dark, damp, and cramped.
									Equipped with a solitary light, you venture forward, discovering large crystals
									that can shift and redirect light beams. Soon, it dawns on you — manipulating 
									these beams unlocks pathways, each puzzle leading closer to an escape.
									<br>
									This was the core concept of a game my team and I developed during our sophomore
									year of college at DigiPen Institute of Technology. The game was called Refraction,
									a nod to the lighting mechanic that was the core of the game. The game spanned a 
									full academic year, and the game was created entirely in a custom-made engine.
									As the engine programmer, I was responsible for building the engine from the ground
									up using a limited toolkit: JSON, SDL2, ImGui, and OpenGL. With just a year of programming
									experience — and even less in C++ — this role was both a challenge and a major
									opportunity for growth.
									<br>
									<h2>Building the Engine</h2>
									<br>
									The first hurdle was getting the engine up and running within a tight time constraint.
									We needed a functional prototype as quickly as possible to support the rest of the team. 
									I knew that I needed to build a solid foundation that could be expanded upon later, especially
									for the lighting systems that would be created by our graphics programmer. I leaned heavily
									on preventative measures: designing the code to handle potential errors gracefully and 
									implementing safe coding practices. While the initial steps of creating a custom engine were
									daunting, I managed to produce a basic framework in just two weeks. This framework included
									input handling, scene management, level loading, basic rendering, debugging tools, and anything
									else I could think of that would be useful for the team.
									<br>
									Working on the engine gave me a newfound appreciation for aspects of game development that
									are often invisible to end users. Creating features like scene transitions and level 
									management from scratch revealed the intricacies involved and the importance of a solid
									foundation. In addition, there were countless design choices I had to weigh in on. What engine
									design pattern should I choose? Observer? Composite? Singleton? There was so much to consider,
									but I opted for the singleton pattern due to its simplicity and ease of use. This was just one of
									many decisions that would shape the engine's architecture and the game's development.
									As someone who previously took these systems for granted when using professional
									engines, this was an eye-opening experience.

									<h2>Optimizing Performance</h2>
									<br>
									One of the most significant challenges we faced was performance optimization. Our game 
									initially struggled to maintain even 30 FPS. Given my familiarity with the engine, I took 
									the lead in diagnosing bottlenecks. This required diving into the graphics programmer's code,
									experimenting with Visual Studio's Profiler, and creating ImGui tools to track performance metrics
									in real time.
									<br>
									A key decision was made right before this optimization phase: our graphics programmer wanted to
									perform lighting calculations on the CPU rather than the GPU. The lighting system relied on pixel-by-pixel
									math calculations, and using the CPU allowed the graphics programmer to maintain precise control over each
									individual pixel. While this method offered flexibility and allowed for the unique lighting effect we sought
									to create, it came at the cost of significant performance overhead. GPUs are designed for parallel processing
									and would typically be far more efficient for this type of computation. However, at the time, our team prioritized
									the control and simplicity of the CPU-based approach. We wanted to test the boundaries of what we could do, and
									although this decision contributed to the challenges we faced in maintaining stability and performance, it also 
									allowed us to create a unique and visually striking game. 
									<br>
									While I made some improvements, my limited experience meant there were persistent inefficiencies. Despite my best 
									efforts, we couldn't fully address all performance issues within the project's timeline. This was a tough lesson:
									foundational code quality and ongoing maintenance are crucial for long-term success. Our struggles reinforced
									the importance of clean, maintainable code, and proactive profiling —— lessons that I've carried into every project since.
									<br>
									<br>

										<a href="#pic05" class="thumbnail"><img src="images/refractiondemo.gif" alt="Example of lighting and gameplay."></a>
									</div>
									<br>
									<br>
									<h2>Developing an Editor</h2>
									<br>
									With the engine stable enough for continuing production, I took on the task of developing a level editor to streamline
									the designers' workflow. Using ImGui, I built an interface that allowed designers to add and remove entities, import 
									layouts from their planning tools, and adjust properties dynamically. This task required me to dive deep into 
									ImGui's documentation and address compatibility challenges with our engine's OpenGL and SDL2 setup. The process was 
									slow at first, but the final editor significantly improved the team's efficiency. 
									<br>
									Beyond the core editor functionality, I added debugging tools to track entities and their statistics, tracking and allowing
									dynamic modification of particles, dynamic adjustments of lights, display lighting properties, level importing and saving
									from JSON, etc. These tools weren't just useful; they were essential for diagnosing issues during the final stages 
									of development. While the editor wasn't perfect, it marked a major milestone in my understanding of tool development 
									and user-focused design. This process was one of the most difficult, as the documentation was loaded with information
									I had to sort through, and the process of creating the editor was a trial-and-error process. The other programmers were
									essential to get this task done in time, and I am grateful for their help.
									<br>

									<br>
									<br>
									<h2>Final Touches And Lessons</h2>
									<br> As time came to an end, I wrapped up the engine with some final touches to ensure everything was stable 
									and performed as we expected. I aided the graphics programmer in creating the menus —— another hand-made visual
									that tied together our stylization. And with that, we were done.
									<br>
									This project was a crucible of learning experiences:
									<br><strong>Engine Architecture</strong> - Designing the engine entirely myself taught me how critical it is to align 
									architecture with project requirements. The decision to use a singleton pattern, while simple and effective for a 
									student project, highlighted the trade-offs inherent in design decisions.
									<br><strong>Performance Optimization</strong> - Profiling tools and debugging performance bottlenecks were
									invaluable skills I developed. I learned that optimization is as much about identifying problems as it is about
									knowing when to prioritize other tasks. 
									<br><strong>Collaboration</strong> - While working in a small team led to more collaboration and effective communication,
									it also required me to take on multiple roles. I learned to balance my responsibilities and communicate effectively with
									what was needed for the project. This was also one of the first projects where I had to work in parallel with other programmers.
									It reinforced how important it was to provide clear documentation, maintain consistent and clean code, and communicate
									regularly with the team.
									<br><strong>Iterative Development</strong> - The necessity of balancing feature development with performance and usability 
									underscored the iterative nature of game development. As stated before, starting with and maintaining clean, well-documented 
									code is far easier than fixing problems either. Additionally, especially when it came to tool and engine development, I often
									had to go back and revise my work to accommodate new features or changes. This was a lesson in flexibility and adaptability.
									<br>
									<br>
									<h2>The Final Product</h2>
									<br>
									In the end, our team produced a functional, engaging puzzle game with dynamic lighting, handcrafted visuals, and satisfying
									gameplay. The experience taught me as much about teamwork and project management as it did about technical skills.
									From handling conflicts in code and within the team to finding creative solutions under pressure, this project laid the
									foundation for my future growth as a developer. 
									<br>
									To this day, I'm grateful for the challenges and lessons of this project. It wasn't perfect — far from it — but it
									was a pivotal experience in my journey as a programmer and game designer. The experience reinforced my passion for game 
									development and systems programming, and I carry the lessons with every project!

									Getting hacked is awful. Everyone knows it. Yet, the average user does nothing to prevent it. Whether 
									willful ignorance or a lack of understanding, the fact remains: hacking is a real threat. And it can happen
									to anyone! 
									<br>
									But truthfully, I don't blame people for not really taking it seriously. Average users know the bare minimum --
									don't reuse passwords, don't click on suspicious links, don't download sketchy files. But overtime, when you have 
									to remember every single password for every single account you may have in an age where <strong>everything</strong>
									has an account, it becomes a hassle. And when you're busy, you don't have time for hassles. So you take shortcuts.
									You reuse a password once or twice, maybe download a file you weren't sure was secure because hey, who wants to pay
									some of those ridiculous prices for software?
									<br>
									<br>
									But then it happens. You get hacked. And suddenly, you're in a panic. You don't know what to do. You don't know, or 
									why it happened. 
									<br>
									<br>
									See, I was invited to work on a Game Jam with some friends. I had plans to meet in person the next day to work on the 
									Jam. Of course, I was awake until 3:00am, as programmers do. I go to sleep, excited to work. I wake up, ready to message
									my friend over Discord to ask when I should meet them at their apartment. But I can't log in. I try again. And again.
									I try to reset my password, but the email never comes. I try to contact Discord, but they don't respond. Nothing at all.
									I check my Microsoft Teams -- a message from that same friend. "Hey, did you get hacked?" he asked, and I knew immediately 
									that this real.
									<br>
									<br>
									Even now, I don't know for sure how it happened. Maybe a link I clicked without thinking, maybe a security breach,
									or even all those times I reused a password for convience? I don't know. And that, right there, is the problem. There 
									were multiple ways my security was at risk. I <strong>knew</strong> that there were issues, but I didn't do anything about it.
									<br>
									<br>
									"Oh, it wouldn't happen to me," I thought, "I have nothing of value. I won't be a target."
									<br>
									<br>
									Then suddenly I was a target. Hackers don't care who you are. If they want your account, one wrong step and they have it.
									Thankfully, it was just my discord account. But it was a wake-up call. I had to change all my passwords, set up 2FA, 
									change emails -- the whole mile. It took me hours. Even still, I was thankful nothing else had happened.

									<em> "The last frontier is the human mind and we are its pioneers." - Prey 2017 </em>
									<br>
									<br>
									Hello!
									<br>
									<br>
									I am TayLee Young, a third year college student at DigiPen Institute of Technology.
									I am currently studying Computer Science and Game Design. I focus in systems programming, 
									data analysis, and game development. I am proficient in C, C++, C#, and I am learning Python, 
									CSS and HTML. I am also familiar with Unity, Unreal Engine, and Visual Studio.
									<br>
									I have worked on several projects, some of which you can find in the Work section. I have 
									worked teams, big and small, and I have experience in project management and team leadership.
									Of course, I am always looking to expand my knowledge and experience.
									<br>
									<br>
									I am deeply motivated to create games that are more than just entertainment. I want to create
									works of art -- art that inspires people to see things in a new light, to create deeply personal
									and provocative worlds, and to challenge the status quo. I want to not only create games,
									but to create experiences that change people's lives.
									<br>
									I am heavily inspired by games like Prey, Night in the Woods, Journey, Silent Hill,
									and Minecraft. These have impacted my life in ways that I never thought possible. Some 
									inspired my path for game design, others have inspired my deep love and appreciation 
									for the art of creation. I will always remember with fondness the first time I played these games,
									as they have made me who I am today!
									<br>
									<br>
									With every project I am in and every team I am apart of, I push strongly for inclusivity, 
									diversity, and accessibility. I believe that games are for everyone. All people, regardless
									of their background, should experience the joy of this art. As a member of the LGBT+ community,
									I know firsthand the importance of representation, inclusion, and acceptance. No one should 
									feel isolated in their experience. This is my mission and goal. To create games that are for
									everyone, that inspire everyone, and that change everyone.
									<br>
									<br>
									Currently, I am apart of team Practically Malware, creating a student game project
									about catching, selling, and breeding moths. Feel free to read about that too!
									I am looking for internships and job opportunities, so feel free to contact me anytime!
